Description: MetQy facilitates analysis and data mining of KEGG. The package consists of several families of functions.'parseKEGG' functions allow for easy reading and formatting of the KEGG databases. 'query' functions carry out metabolic analysis given genes or genomes (both user-specified or from the KEGG database) and KEGG module search terms. 'plot' and 'analysis' facilitate data visualisation and analyses such as module variance and PCA. 'misc' functions support the other function families.
